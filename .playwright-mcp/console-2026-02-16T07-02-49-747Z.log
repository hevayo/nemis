[   37706ms] [ERROR] React does not recognize the `%s` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `%s` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element. isOpen isopen @ https://hrm.emis.moe.gov.lk/node_modules/.vite/deps/react-dom_client.js?v=607628e7:2402
